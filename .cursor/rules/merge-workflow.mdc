When merging changes from development to main:

1. **Switch to main branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

2. **Merge development branch:**
   ```bash
   git merge development
   ```

3. **Push to remote (optional):**
   - Only push if user explicitly requests it
   - Otherwise, leave it as a local merge
   - If pushing is requested: `git push origin main`

**Workflow:**
- Always merge development â†’ main (not the other way around)
- Keep development branch for ongoing work
- Use main for stable, production-ready code
- Confirm merge was successful before proceeding
