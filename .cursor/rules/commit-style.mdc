When committing changes:
- Keep the change message short and concise
- Aim for below 50 characters when possible
- Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Be specific about what changed
- Avoid unnecessary words like "Update", "Fix", "Change" unless they add clarity

Examples:
- ✅ "Add dark mode toggle"
- ✅ "Remove unused dependencies"
- ✅ "Update navigation component"
- ❌ "This commit updates the navigation component to fix the mobile menu issue"
