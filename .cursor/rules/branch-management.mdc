**Branch Management Rule:**

- At the start of every new chat or dev session, check the current git branch.
- If not on `development`, switch to it:  
  `git checkout development`
- Confirm with `git status` before making changes.
- Only use `main` for hotfixes or if explicitly instructed.

Default to `development` for all new features and improvements.
